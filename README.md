## Java

### Core / Advanced
- **Blocking Queue**: // TODO
- **Collections**:
  - **HashMap**: collision
      > Keep in mind that itâ€™s the hash value of the key that determines the bucket the object will be stored in. And so, if the hash codes of any two keys collide, their entries will still be stored in the same bucket (implemented by LinkedList).

### Memory Allocation:
- **Stack**:
- **Heap**: // TODO: deep dive to garbage collection.

### Pass By Value:
- **Why java is pass by value**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value
  
### Keywords
- **Volatile**: Make sure that, all threads are reading/writing to latest value in main memory(only suitable for simple operation, not for atomic operation).
- **Static**: static block, variables are loaded at first when class's loaded by ClassLoader. Static things is managed by JVM, and thread-safe.
- **Synchronized**: to make process handled synchronously using lock mechanism. It's expensive, but why?
  - Locking.
  - Context Switching: ff a thread is waiting for a lock that is held by another thread, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs to perform a context switch, which involves saving the current thread's state and restoring the state of the thread that holds the lock.

### Non-blocking
- **I/O and Concurrency**: Implementing non-blocking I/O and concurrency mechanisms in Java applications.

### Threading
- **ThreadLocal**: use to store data for each thread like user logged in info, user JWT token, etc.
- **Deadlock**: Identifying and resolving deadlocks in multithreaded applications. Using `Reentrant Lock` to prevent `DeadLock` (timeout for locking)
- **Race Condition**: Preventing race conditions through proper synchronization. ([Source Code](https://github.com/duylv27/theory/tree/main/threading-sample/threading))
  - **Reentrant Lock**:
    - **Pros**: Flexible (e.g., `tryLock()`, `tryLock(time, time)`), useful for complex processes, can be conditional, cost-effective.
    - **Cons**: Complex to implement.
  - **Synchronized**: Ensures all-or-nothing execution, involves context switching (costly).
  - **Atomic**: Safe and effective for managing variables. // TODO: Deep dive into atomic variables and their usage.
